          Hello! Iâ€™m Andrea, a self-taught Javascript developer based in Brno,
          Czech Republic. My background is not exactly Computer Science, but rather social sciences and humanities. I've been working for the past 13 years in international organisations, focusing on online communications. In the past three years, I took up web development and created a number of web & mobile applications for work and for fun. On the front-end, my tool of choice is ReactJS, and React Native on mobile. I also love working with GatsbyJS. On the back-end, I usually reach for NodeJs, Express and MongoDB. This is the stack I'm currently comfortable with, but I'm always excited to learn new stuff (currently having a go at GraphQL and TypeScript).

        <CodeTechnology />
      </Content>
    </SkewedContainer>
