            Hello! Iâ€™m Andrea, a self-taught Javascript developer based in Brno,
            Czech Republic. My background is not exactly Computer Science, but
            rather social sciences and humanities. I've been working for the past
            13 years in international organisations, focusing on online
            communications. In the past three years, I took up web development and
            created a number of web & mobile applications for work and for fun. On
            the front-end, my tool of choice is ReactJS, and React Native on
            mobile. I also love the development experience offered by GatsbyJS. On
            the back-end, I usually reach for NodeJs, Express and MongoDB. This is
            the stack I'm currently comfortable with, but I'm always excited to
            learn new stuff (currently having a go at GraphQL and TypeScript).
